        <h2>Earn 1 — 4 Credits</h2>
        <p>The number of credit hours you earn is negotiable between you and your faculty sponsor. If you choose this option, you and your sponsor will need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine how many credit hours you will earn (1 — 4).</li>
            <li>Decide exactly what is expected of you, such as your time commitment (no more than 12 hours per week) and the type of work to be submitted.</li>
            <li>Agree on how your grade will be determined.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please refer to <a href="http://finance.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=79">this link</a> for additional information regarding credit hours. During the summer term, you will be billed for each URP credit hour for which you register.</p>

        <h3>Applying for Credit</h3>
        <p>With your sponsor, complete the <strong>4UR Form</strong> and submit via the Registrar’s website under <strong>Registrar Requests</strong>. Be sure to CC your department's URP Coordinator.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Submit a 4UR Form</strong></p>
        <p>Fall 2023 applications are due Monday September 11th, 2023.</p>
        <p>(The Registrar's "Add Course" deadline.)</p>

        <h2>URP for Funding</h2>
        <p><strong>FUNDING SOURCE: Sponsoring Faculty Member or Department</strong></p>
        <p>The faculty sponsor or department is responsible for the financial support of your research. The URP application should be submitted to the URP Coordinator for the department in which you are working.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reviews the URP application for completeness.</li>
            <li>Processes your payroll request.</li>
            <li>Forwards the URP application to the Office of Undergraduate Education for approval.</li>
            <li>Will set up a schedule for reporting your hours via web-time entry.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>FUNDING MATCH: The Office of Undergraduate Education</strong></p>
        <p>The Office of Undergraduate Education pays URP participants up to a maximum of $500 per semester in the form of matching funds. Applications that are submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Education that do not contain funding from the sponsoring department will not be approved for matching funds. Applications requesting funding from the Office of Undergraduate Education that are received after the application deadline will not be approved for matching funds. However, the sponsoring department's funding will be approved.</p>

        <h3>Applying for Funding</h3>
        <p>Complete the <strong>URP Application for Funding</strong> and obtain the required signatures. Completed applications should be emailed to the appropriate URP Coordinator. Email confirmation from the faculty research supervisor in lieu of a signature on the form will be accepted.</p>
        <p>Fall 2023 applications are due Monday September 11th, 2023.</p>
        <p>(The Registrar's "Add Course" deadline.)</p>

        <h3>Getting Paid</h3>
        <p>You and your sponsor determine the total amount you will earn and rate of pay. The minimum hourly rate for the URP is $14.20, however, the rate that the sponsoring faculty member pays to you from their funds is negotiable. Decide how much time you will work; most projects expect eight hours per week not to exceed twelve hours of research per week. Paychecks are issued every other Friday.</p>
