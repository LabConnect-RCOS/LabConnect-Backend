### 1. Communication is Key: Emailing Professors

- **Be Clear and Concise:** Clearly state your purpose, ask your questions, and express your interest in the project.

### 2. Don’t Get Discouraged: Follow up In-Person

- **Office Visits:** If you don’t receive a response via email, try finding the professors in their office spaces. It demonstrates your commitment and can sometimes lead to more fruitful conversations.

- **Be Respectful:** Respect their time and be prepared to introduce yourself and explain why you are interested in their project.

### 3. Missed the Deadline? It’s Not Always Over!

- **Ask Politely:** If you’ve missed a deadline, it’s worth reaching out to ask if you can still participate. Some professors can be quite lenient and understanding.

- **Unofficial Participation:** Even if it's past the deadline, some students can still work on a project they are interested in, albeit unofficially. It’s about the learning experience!
