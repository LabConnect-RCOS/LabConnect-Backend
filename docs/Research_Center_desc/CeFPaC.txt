ABOUT: CeFPaC was founded in 2012 with a main objective to link between fundamental research and application.  The mission of CeFPaC is to conduct research  in flow physics, prediction, modeling and control. The center has two main thrusts:  (i) Aerodynamics (aerial, ground, and underwater vehicles), and (ii) wind energy (smart wind turbine blades, building integrated wind, and smart buildings).The research at CeFPaC is interdisciplinary where projects span from designing and testing of smart blades for wind turbines to developing new techniques for reducing aircraft drag.
