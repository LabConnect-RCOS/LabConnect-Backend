The Center for Deep Listening at Rensselaer stewards the practice of Deep Listening® developed by composer Pauline 
Oliveros. Deep Listening is, in Oliveros’ words, “a way of listening in every possible way to everything possible, 
to hear no matter what you are doing.” Our mission at the Center for Deep Listening is to foster creative innovation
across boundaries and abilities, among artists and audiences, musicians and non-musicians, and children of all ages.
Established at Rensselaer in June 2014 under the guidance of founding Director, Tomie Hahn, the Center for Deep 
Listening offers online introductory courses, intensives and certification in Deep Listening, houses the archives of
the Deep Listening Institute (founded by Oliveros in 1985), sponsors workshops and retreats in a range of community 
settings, and connects students with an international community of Deep Listening teachers.
