ABOUT:The Center for Initiatives in Pre-College Education (CIPCE) is an official pre-college outreach arm of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. As such, it is committed to working with K-12 students and teachers on inquiry- based approaches to teaching in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) disciplines, making use of engaging interactive technologies that have proven to be effective classroom tools.
