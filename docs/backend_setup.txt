1. Install python and dependencies

    Run this line by line:
    sudo -i -u postgres
    psql
    ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'root';
    \q
    exit

    Copy Paste and Run:
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    sudo -u postgres createdb labconnect

2. Test installation

Run:
    make test

    Testing isnt working great so you should get 48 failed, 7 passed, this is just
    to check that the db is working for make develop
