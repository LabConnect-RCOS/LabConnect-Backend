1. Install python and dependencies

    Copy Paste and Run:
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    sudo apt install postgresql

    Run this line by line:
    sudo -i -u postgres
    psql
    ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'root';
    \q
    exit

    Run:
    sudo -u postgres createdb labconnect
